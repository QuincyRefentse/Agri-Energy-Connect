# 🌾 Agri-Energy-Connect

Agri-Energy-Connect is a modern web-based platform developed using **ASP.NET Core MVC** with **Identity** for authentication and role-based authorization. The system facilitates streamlined interaction between farmers and the administrative body (employees) by enabling efficient product management and access control.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

Agri-Energy-Connect is designed to empower **farmers** to upload, manage, and showcase agricultural products, while giving **employees** (admins) the ability to oversee operations, manage farmers, and maintain the integrity of the system. It is tailored for the South African agriculture market but flexible for global extension.

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core MVC** – Backend framework for building dynamic web apps.
- **Entity Framework Core** – ORM for database communication.
- **ASP.NET Identity** – Handles user authentication and role-based authorization.
- **Bootstrap 5** – For modern and responsive UI.
- **Razor Views** – Server-side rendering of HTML.
- **SQL Server** – Primary database.
- **LINQ & Lambda** – Used for querying and filtering data.
